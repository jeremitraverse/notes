# LOCAL DISCOVERIES AND GLOBAL AMELIORATION

## CHATOPS
- Can use software like Slack with bots to keep us up to date on deployments status
- Not only for deployments, but generally for all of the ops practices (telemetries, server status)

### PROS
- Leave trails about when/why for each deployments
- Facilitate the integration of new devs

## NORMALIZED PROCESSES AUTOMATION
- Instead of having docs about different practices (naming convention, space vs tabs..)
  we use tools that automate these processes (linters, security breach detection etc..)

## ARCHOPS
- Compare current architecture and ops

## SINGLE REPO PATTERN
- Having a single repo for all of our microservices increases the chance that those
  microservices use the same packages version
- One person has the ownership's of either a librairy or service
  - Decide when to upgrade/downgrade

## SHARE KNOWLEDGE THROUGH UNIT TESTS
- Learn about I/Os of different section of the code base
- Understand the code execution workflow
- API's functionalies

## REUSABLE USER STORIES
- Summarized functionalites/use-case
  - Effort estimation
  - How are we gonna test this functionality/use-case
