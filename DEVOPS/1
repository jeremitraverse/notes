## FIRST WAY
- Dev send changed to ops
  - Infrastructure problems, because often created manually
    - Takes time because ops engineer are busy and understaff
    - Prone to low quality
      - Human error
      - All the good practice that we have for the codebase won't
        be applied to the infrastructure
