# CHATOPS
- Can use software like Slack with bots to keep us up to date on deployments status
- Not only for deployments, but generally for all of the ops practices (telemetries, server status)

## PROS
- Leave trails about when/why for each deployments
- Facilitate the integration of new devs

## Normalized processes automation
- Instead of having docs about different practices (naming convention, space vs tabs..)
  we use tools that automate these processes (linters, security breach detection etc..)
