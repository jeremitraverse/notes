    implementation of tools/process that human uses
- Push people to take risks for the sake of innovation

## BLAMELESS POST-MORTEM
- The host of the post-mortem meeting should be an expert
- Search for the root of the problem and not the person that caused the problem
- Publish the port-mortem report and push other people to read these reports increase
  the learning of the overall team
