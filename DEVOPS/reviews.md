## PAIR REVIEWS
- Revision made internally.
- Best moment to make/ask for a pair review is before merging to the main branch
- Revision is made by either an expert or 2 other devs
- The smaller the commit is, the better the revision will be

- A lot of devs doesn't like to have someone constanlty checking over their shoulder
- Can improve productivity (maybe reduce the stress associated to coding new features)
- Managers doesn't understand the usefulness of par programming because they think that 
  it's a waste of a dev's time

- How can evaluate the quality of a PR
